<p> Hi! </p>

<p> Thank you for agreeing to test our prototype </p>
<p> We are currently doing a project for the Games & Learning course, for which we have to build a mobile application proto-type.</p>==
<p> The purpose of the application is to visually represent the team constellation. A team constellation is a depiction of the team's structure and relationship to each other and the task, as perceived by yourself. This application should foster an improvemnet in the team dynamics and stimulate active discussion about the functioning of the team.</p> 
<p> For the purpose of this exercise, please be aware that not all of the elements of the application are functioning. Therefore, we would like you to only focus on the Team Login section within the app, and please select Team A from the List of Teams that you will encounter.</p>
<p>You could help us by commenting on the clarity of the instructions, the app's structure, and the main objective of the application: do you feel like there is something missing, or that something needs to be elucidated?</p>
<p> When you click on the app, it will open in a new tab so that you can go back to this page to write any comments that you might have in the form below.</p>
<p> When you are ready click the link below to get started</p>
